# Visual Fill Column #

`visual-fill-column-mode` is a small Emacs minor mode that mimics the effect of `fill-column` in `visual-line-mode`. Instead of wrapping lines at the window edge, which is the standard behaviour of `visual-line-mode`, it wraps lines at `fill-column`. If `fill-column` is too large for the window, the text is wrapped at the window edge.


## Installation ##

`visual-fill-column` can be installed via [Melpa](http://melpa.org).


## Activation ##

`visual-fill-column-mode` is primarily intended to be used alongside `visual-line-mode`. If this is your desired use-case , the way to activate `visual-fill-column-mode` depends on how you activate `visual-line-mode`.

If you activate `visual-line-mode` by using `global-visual-line-mode`, you can use `global-visual-fill-column-mode` (either set the user option through Customize, or call it as a function in your init file). `global-visual-fill-column-mode` turns on `visual-fill-column-mode` in every buffer that uses `visual-line-mode`, but only if this buffer is visiting a file.

`visual-fill-column-mode` can also be turned on in hooks. For example, if you don't use `global-visual-line-mode` but still prefer to activate `visual-fill-column-mode` in every buffer that uses `visual-line-mode`, you can add `visual-fill-column-mode` to `visual-line-mode-hook`:

    (add-hook 'visual-line-mode-hook #'visual-fill-column-mode)

Both these methods have the effect that `visual-fill-column-mode` is used in every buffer that uses `visual-line-mode`. If that's not what you want, you can also use the reverse method: add `visual-line-mode` to `visual-fill-column-mode-hook`:

    (add-hook 'visual-fill-column-mode-hook #'visual-line-mode)

This way, whenever you activate `visual-fill-column-mode` (e.g., interactively with `M-x visual-fill-column-mode` or in a major mode hook), `visual-line-mode` is also activated, but you can still activate `visual-line-mode` without using `visual-fill-column-mode`.

Note that `visual-fill-column-mode` is not tied to `visual-line-mode`: it is perfectly possible to use it on its own.

`visual-fill-column-mode` works by widening the right window margin. This reduces the area that is available for text display, creating the appearance that the text is wrapped at `fill-column`. The amount by which the right margin is widened depends on the window width and is automatically adjusted when the window’s width changes (e.g., when the window is split in two side-by-side windows).

In buffers that are explicitly right-to-left (i.e., those where `bidi-paragraph-direction` is set to `right-to-left`), the left margin is expanded, so that the text appears at the window’s right side.

Widening the margin normally causes the fringes to be pushed inward. Since this is visually less appealing, the fringes are placed outside the margins. You can undo this by setting the variable `visual-fill-column-fringes-outside-margins` to `nil`.


## Splitting a Window ##

Emacs won’t vertically split a window (i.e., into two side-by-side windows) that has wide margins. As a result, displaying buffers such as `*Help*` buffers, `*Completion*` buffers, etc., won’t split a window vertically, even if there appears to be enough space for a vertical split. This is not problematic, but it may be undesirable. To remedy this, you can set the option `split-window-preferred-function` to `visual-fill-column-split-window-sensibly`. This function first unsets the margins and then calls `split-window-sensibly` to do the actual splitting.


## Adjusting Text Size ##

The width of the margins is adjusted for the text size: larger text size means smaller margins. However, interactive adjustments to the text size (e.g., with `text-size-adjust`) cannot be detected by `visual-fill-column-mode`, therefore if you adjust the text size while `visual-fill-column-mode` is active, the margins won't be adjusted. To remedy this, you can force a redisplay, e.g., by switching buffers, by splitting and unsplitting the window or by calling `redraw-display`.

Alternatively, you can advise the function `text-size-adjust` (or whatever function you use to adjust the text size) with the function `visual-fill-column-adjust`:

    (advice-add 'text-scale-adjust :after
      #'visual-fill-column-adjust)


## Options ##

`visual-fill-column-width`: column at which to wrap lines. If set to `nil` (the default), use the value of `fill-column` instead.

`visual-fill-column-center-text`: if set to `t`, centre the text area in the window. By default, the text is displayed at the window’s (left) edge, mimicking the effect of `fill-column`.

`visual-fill-column-fringes-outside-margins`: if set to `t`, put the fringes outside the margins.

All three options are buffer-local, so the values you set through Customize are default values. They can also be set in mode hooks or directory or file local variables in order to customise particular files or file types.
